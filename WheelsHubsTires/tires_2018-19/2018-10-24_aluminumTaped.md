# Aluminum tire tests

Data collection performed by Shomik Verma and Jia Dua.  
Document written by Gerry Chen.

The purpose of these tests is to evaluate if covering the aluminum tires with tape enhances the rolling resistance on rough surfaces.

As background, it was established using the pendulum testing device that aluminum tires perform well on an aluminum floor and perform reasonably on the epoxy surface inside the DEV workspace.  However, when moving to more realistically rough surfaces such as the cement or asphalt outside, the aluminum tires perform poorly (data needs to be located).

One proposed explanation is slippage.  Another proposed explanation is too little "suspension".  This test wrapped the aluminum tires with tapes to see if it would improve the rolling resistance.
